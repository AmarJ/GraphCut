Kaptur is an image segmentation tool. At the heart of Kaptur lies a graph theory model that overlays images with graphs segmenting several layers of foreground elements from the background.

## Use cases:

### Digitize images
Kaptur can digitizes hand drawn art, diagrams and signatures. Simply snap a picture of your creation and run it through Kaptur to convert your drawing into a digital vectored image with a transparent background.

### Computer Vision
Kaptur can be applied to the field of computer vision. Kaptur's image segmentaiton approach can be used to precisely locate objects and their boundaries and can also detect movement in a set of images. 

Still under development.
