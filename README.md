***GraphCut*** is an image segmentation tool. At the heart of Kaptur GraphCut is a graph theory model that overlays an image with a graph. The foreground is then segmented from the image using a graph cut algorithm based off Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm from the [Graph Cuts and Efficient N-D Image Segmentation](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yuri/Papers/pami04.pdf) paper by researchers Dr. Boykov and Dr. Kolmogorov.
