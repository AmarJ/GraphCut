Kaptur is redefining image segmentation. At the heart of Kaptur lies a graph theory model that overlays images with graphs segmenting foreground elements from the background.

## Use cases:

### Digitize images
Kaptur can digitizes hand drawn art, diagrams and signatures. Simply snap a picture of your creation and run it through Kaptur to convert your drawing into a digital image with a transparent background.

### Computer Vision

Kaptur can be applied to the field of computer vision in order to extract valuable information from images. Kaptur can detect different objects in the pictures and also detect movement in a set of images. 

Still under development.
