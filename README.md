Kaptur GraphCut is an image segmentation tool. At the heart of Kaptur GraphCut lies a graph theory model that overlays an image with a graph. That foreground is then segmented using a graph cut algorithm based of Dr. Boykov and Dr. Funka-LeaÂ approach detailed in their paper: [Graph Cuts and Efficient N-D Image Segmentation](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yuri/Papers/ijcv06.pdf). 

I am developing Kaptur GraphCut to use with my Kaptur logo detection tool as a way to quickly extract foreground objects in an image. I would then all these objects through Kaptur to see if they are indeed logos. This would be used instead of the conventional [sliding window approach](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs543/sp2011/lectures/Lecture%2019%20-%20Sliding%20Window%20Detection%20-%20Vision_Spring2011.pdf).

The approach where I merge Kaptur and Kaptur GraphCut into one really neat tool is in a private repo. Please email me at amarjasarbasic@gmail.com if you would like me to send you the contents of that repo.
